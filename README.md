# 🌿 FarmERP Pro

An enterprise-grade **Farm ERP platform** for agricultural businesses and plantation management companies. It digitizes workforce, payroll, agronomy, inventory, finance, planning, reporting and administration across multiple farms from one centralized system.

> **Stack:** Django REST Framework + PostgreSQL (backend) · React + Tailwind CSS + Vite (web admin) · React Native / Expo (mobile) · JWT auth with refresh tokens and role-based access.

`SUPER_ADMIN` · `FARM_MANAGER` · `EMPLOYEE`

Access is **role-based** *and* **farm-scoped** — non-global users only see data for farms they are assigned to. Every write is recorded in the audit trail.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+**, **Node.js 18+**, **PostgreSQL 14+**

### 1. Database
Create the database (see [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for OS-specific details):
```bash
createdb farmerp        # or: psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE farmerp"
```

### 2. Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows:  venv\Scripts\activate     |  macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # then edit DB credentials
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_demo    # demo users + sample data
python manage.py runserver    # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
API docs: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/** · Admin: **/admin/**

### 3. Web frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:5173  (proxies /api to :8000)
```

### 4. Mobile app
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start                # scan QR with Expo Go, or press a / i
```
See [mobile/README.md](mobile/README.md) to point `API_BASE` at your machine.

## 🛠️ System capabilities mapped to requirements

- **Offline-first** — mobile app queues captures in local storage and syncs on demand.
- **Real-time-ish sync** — REST API with token refresh; pull-to-refresh on mobile.
- **GPS** — browser & device geolocation on attendance and activities; geofences per farm.
- **Camera** — photo capture on mobile attendance/field-activity; image upload on web.
- **RBAC** — enforced server-side (permissions + farm scoping) and client-side (route guards, nav filtering).
- **Audit trail** — `AuditTrailMiddleware` logs every authenticated write.
- **Notifications** — `notifications` app + `notify()` helper; FCM token field on user (wire Firebase to push).
- **Multi-farm scalability** — every domain record is farm-scoped; users hold M2M farm assignments.
- **Export PDF/Excel** — report endpoints return structured JSON ready for client-side export.
- **Cloud storage** — set `USE_S3=True` + AWS keys in `.env` to switch media to S3.
- **Multi-language** — Django i18n configured for en/hi/mr/ta/te; user `preferred_language`.

## 📐 Architecture notes
- JWT access + rotating refresh tokens (`djangorestframework-simplejwt`) with blacklist on logout.
- Generic, config-driven CRUD UI (`CrudResource`) keeps the web admin DRY across modules.
- Each Django app is self-contained (models / serializers / views / urls / admin) and registered in `config/settings.py`.

See module-specific READMEs in each subfolder.
