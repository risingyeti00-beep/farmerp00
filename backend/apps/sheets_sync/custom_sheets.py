"""
Curated worksheets that are not a plain one-model-one-table mirror.

The normal registry mirrors a whole business table (see ``registry.py``).
Some sheets are instead a *filtered view* of a table that the registry
deliberately excludes — e.g. "Super Admins", a roster of the owner
accounts drawn from ``accounts.User`` (an app excluded from the automatic
mirror because it holds authentication data).

A custom sheet is defined by a builder returning ``(title, headers, rows)``
and is always written whole via ``client.replace_all_rows`` — these sheets
are small, so a full rewrite is cheaper and simpler than a keyed upsert.
