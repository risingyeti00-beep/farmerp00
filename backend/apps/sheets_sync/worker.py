"""
In-process background worker that pushes committed Supabase records to
Google Sheets.

Jobs are enqueued from ``transaction.on_commit`` hooks, so the database
write has already succeeded by the time a job exists; API responses never
wait on the Sheets API.  The worker runs in a daemon thread.

Reliability model:

* **Batching** — the worker drains everything queued (up to a cap) in one
  cycle and groups jobs per table, so N rapid writes to one table cost a
  couple of API calls instead of N.
* **Coalescing** — duplicate jobs for the same record are merged while
  queued; only the latest database state is ever written.
* **Retry with backoff** — a failed batch is re-queued per-job with
  exponential backoff (5s → 10s → … capped at 5 min, max 8 attempts).
  Quota (429) and transient (5xx) errors additionally retry inside each
  API call (see ``client.with_retry``).
* **Audit trail** — every operation outcome is recorded in the
  :class:`~apps.sheets_sync.models.SyncLog` table: table name, record id,
  operation, timestamp, status, error.
